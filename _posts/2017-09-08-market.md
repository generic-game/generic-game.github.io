## Stock management

A shop only need a name to be created, the items are optional. To instanciate a
`Shop`, use:

```js
new gg.class.Shop({
  name: 'Generic shop'
})
```

or instanciating with items:

> May or may not be **ShopItem** instance

```js
new gg.class.Shop({
  name: 'Generic shop',
  items: [
    {
      item: new gg.class.Vest({
        name: 'Armet',
        slotType: {name: 'helmet'},
        type: gg.const.item.EQUIPABLE,
        effects: [
          new gg.class.Characteristic({name: gg.const.characteristic.DEFENSE, value: 1})
        ]
      }),
      price: new gg.class.Currency({
        name: 'Gold',
        symbol: 'G',
        value: 100
      })
    }
  ]
})
```

### stocking items

It's possible to add more items in the shop after instanciation. Use `addItem`:

```js
const armet = new gg.class.Vest({
  name: 'Armet',
  slotType: {name: 'helmet'},
  type: gg.const.item.EQUIPABLE,
  effects: [
    new gg.class.Characteristic({name: gg.const.characteristic.DEFENSE, value: 1})
  ]
})
const goldCurrency = new gg.class.Currency({
  name: 'Gold',
  symbol: 'G',
  value: 100
})

shop.addItem({item: armet, price: goldCurrency})
```

and removing:

```js
shop.removeItem(armet)
```

> Once you remove all items, they vanish from shop istead having quantity equals
zero


## Trading

To make a character interact with shop, you can use `buy` and `sell`:

### buying and selling

> The character must have the items in inventory before selling;
> The character can't sell the same instance more than twice.

```js
hero.interact(shop).sell(someShopItemFromShop)
// <- Promise
```

> The character must afford to buy the item;
> The character must be able to carry the item.

```js
hero.interact(shop).buy(someShopItemFromShop)
// <- Promise
```
