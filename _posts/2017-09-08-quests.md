Every quest is composed of a description and it's steps following the
currencies/items/experience as rewards.

## Quest steps

The quests don't have a conclusion order, it's possible to finish them in any
order. Create a quest using:

```js
new gg.class.Quest({
  text: 'Kill something',
  steps: [{
    text: 'An orc',
    reward: new gg.class.Experience({
      value: 10
    })
  }]
})
```


## Rewards

For the character get the rewards from the quest, `claimReward` can be used:

```js
hero.interact(quest).claimReward()
// <- Promise
```

The character will gain the experience. If the reward is a item, it goes to his
inventory.
